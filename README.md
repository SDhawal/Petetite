# Petetite <br> *(Your Pet's Appetite)*
### <p> I have two dogs and some times I forget weather I had feeded them or is there water in their wate pan? <br> when was the last time I vaccinated them or when is the next date for their deworming?<br> </p> <p> So I came up with an idea of PETETITE application , In this application user can feed anything they want like the bathing schedule , vaccination and deworming schedule , Feeding and water refilling schedule . Once user will feed all these information user will get notified by the app  </p>
### Technologies Used : <br> Android Studios (JAVA) <br> Room database <br>
#### I am still working on this application and keep on improving it to provide best user experience.
